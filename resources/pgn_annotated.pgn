1. e4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch. From a match; the first game in
which appears my idea of a pawn sacrifice in the opening, not
to obtain an attack, but merely, with gain of a tempo, to
overprotect a strategical point with a view to cramping the
enemy forces.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. Qg4 {My innovation.}

10. Re1 {White's plan is now clear. He has given up a pawn,
careless when, if ever, he recovers it provided his pawn at e5
is maintained as an instrument to cramp Black's game. There is
no idea of attack in 9 h4, its object is solely to pave the
way to the removal of some of the pressure on the p at e5. The
pawn sacrifice comes with the category of sacrifice for the
sake of blockade.} Bd7 {...Bc5 was essaential here so as to
leave the f8 square free for the knight to retreat after h5.}
11. a3 O-O-O 12. b4 {White could, of course, have won the
exchange here by 12 h5 Ne7 13 Ng5 Re8 14 Nf7 Rg8 15 Nd6+; but
with his undeveloped queenside and his unprotected p at h5 he
would have had some difficulties to contend with. The text
move is the logical continuation.} a6 {Rather better was

Bxa7+ Kc8 18 Re1c1+ Bc6 19 b5 Qxb5 20 Nd4 with complications,
which, of course, White, had he been so minded, could have
avoided by simply playing 13 Bb2.} 13. h5 Nge7 14. Bd2 h6
15. a4 g5 16. b5 f4 17. Qg4 {The queen is well placed here.}
Nb8 18. c3 Re8 {His only move. It will be noted that the
over-protector, the rook at e1, now has the c-file opened for
him without any trouble to himself. In order to avoid loss of
material Black has to submit to curious regrouping of his
forces.} 19. cxd4 Kd8 20. Rc1 Qb6 21. a5 Qa7 22. b6 Qa8 {The
queen finds herself in a position to which, as a rule, she
would only be consigned in a problem.} 23. Rc7 Nf5 24. Nc3 Be7
